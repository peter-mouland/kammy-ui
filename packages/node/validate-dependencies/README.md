# Dependency Radar

> A CLI Tool to enable risk analysis of out of date dependencies to be made

- Run: `radar`

This should be run in the root of one of our JS projects:
_ global-website.ssg
_ global-website.cms
_ js-modules.verticals
_ js-modules.config
_ js-modules.node
_ js-modules.rainbow
_ js-modules.library
_ npm-components

All the above projects need to be downloaded onto your machine and you should be on the latest version of the master branch _before_ running `radar`.

## Output

`radar.csv` will be created which includes a tonne of interesting information about our depdencies.

The output is to be used by ThoughtWorks Tech-Radar which we are abusing to highlight our own dependencies.
