# a11y

Some quick reminders about Accessibility

## TL;DR
 * Good A11y starts with good semantic markup
 * Don't forget to use the keyboard's tab key and VoiceOver's Rotor to check the site
 * Use JavaScript together with ARIA when markup isn't enough
 * [#A11y](https://twitter.com/hashtag/a11y) checklist
   * [ ] Is the heading hierarchy correct?
   * [ ] Do links make sense and are easy to differentiate?
   * [ ] Do all the important [HTML Landmarks](#Landmarks) exist?
   * [ ] Does using the tab key highlight items in a logical order?
   * [ ] Are controls be reachable and actionable by keyboard?
 * A11y also helps SEO

## Intro

Making sites accessible is an important way to help those who may have difficulties otherwise using websites, and as a side affect, a way of potentially improving SEO.

## Landmarks
   
Landmarks are a quick and easy way to mark out sections of page content and inform the browser / screen-reader what the purpose of that section is.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td> &lt;main role="main"> </td>
        <td><strong>The main content of a document.</strong><br> 
            <small>This marks the content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of the document. <br />
            This content should be unique to the document and exclude any content repeated content e..g sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos. <br/> 
            </small>
            <em>Note: There should be no more than one element with the main role.</em> <br />

        </td>
    </tr><tr>
        <td> &lt;header role="banner"> </td>
        <td><strong>A region that contains the prime heading or internal title of a page.</strong><br>
<small>Most of the content of a banner is site-oriented, rather than being page-specific.</small><br> 
<small>For Example, logo, the main heading for the page, and site-specific search tool. </small><br>
<em>Note: There should be no more than one element with the banner role.</em><br>

</tr>
    <tr>
        <td> &lt;nav role="navigation"></td>
      <td><strong>A collection of major navigational elements (usually links) for navigating the document or related documents. </strong><br />
        <small>Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element only sections that consist of major navigation blocks are appropriate for the nav element. In particular, footers often have a list of links, but the footer element is more appropriate and no nav element is necessary.</small><br />

</tr>
    <tr>
        <td> &lt;aside role="complimentary"></td>
<td><strong>A supporting section of the document that remains meaningful even when separated from the main content. </strong><br />
The content should be relevant to the main content; if it is completely separable, a more general role should be used instead. 
<small>For example, in the case of a portal, this may include show times, current weather, related articles, or stocks to watch. </small><br />

                                  <td> &lt;article role=”article”></td>
<td><strong>A self-contained composition in a document which is can be independently distributable or reusable.</strong><br /> 
This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, an object, or any other independent item of content. Each article should be identified, typically by including a heading as a child. </small><br />

                                    <td> &lt;form role="form"></td>
<td><strong>A collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing.</strong><br /> 
The form element can be missed due to developers submitting with JS. Don't forget to add a submit button and for all the elements to be wrapped in a form tag! </small><br />

                             <td> &lt;footer role="contentinfo"></td>
<td><strong>Metadata that applies to the parent document.</strong><br />
